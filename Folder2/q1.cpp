/*
Write a structure tag and short main program that sets up a struct for a 
Super Eagles player that contains his name, earned run average (ERA), 
and team. In the program, declare one pitcher variable and pass its address to a function called Smokinâ€™. 

This function fills the pitcher variable with the following information:

Name: Mikel Obi ERA: $ 10 million
Team: Chelsea
Once the data is in the structure, write the pitcher information to the screen.

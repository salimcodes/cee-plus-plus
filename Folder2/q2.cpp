/*
Write a program that sets up an overloaded function set called GetRandomNum. 
These functions return a random number that is generated with stdlib.hâ€™s srand() and rand(). 
You will need to use the modulus function to do a little math to obtain the desired results. 
There are three different prototypes for the GetRandomNum function:

(i) Pass in a positive integer m and it returns an integer value between 0 and m-1.
int GetRandomNum(int m);
(ii) Pass in two integers (assume i and j are zero or positive and i < j) and receive a random integer between but not including i and j.
int GetRandom(int i, int j);
(iii) Void call returns a random number between 0.000 and 1.000. Assume that three digits of
precision are necessary.
double GetRandom();

Your program should make three calls to GetRandom: once obtaining a number between 0 and
27, once obtaining a number between 3 and 73, and last obtaining a number between 0.0 and
1.0. Write all three numbers to the screen.

Write a structure tag and short main program that sets up a struct for a baseball pitcher that
contains his name, earned run average (ERA), 
innings pitched and strikeout percentage. 
In the program, declare one pitcher variable and pass its address to a function called Smokin’. 
This function fills the pitcher variable with the following information:
Name: Smokin’ Joe Green ERA: 1.2
Innings pitched: 55 Strikeout percentage: 0.25
Once the data is in the structure, write the pitcher information to the screen.
